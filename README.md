For our final project, we are analyzing the relationship between the type and quantity of 911 calls within neighborhoods in Seattle and its demographics. Our research question being, Is there a correlation between the type of 911 calls and demographics in an area? The topic at hand is very relevant as we can use this data to predict hot spots of different types of incidences. For example, if we are able to locate areas that have observed more 911 calls which require advice life care services and medical attention, the city can address the need and create more ambulance staging areas to improve the efficiency of caring for the residents in those areas. Another example is if an area has observed higher rates of fire calls, the city can see where they can more strategically put the fire departments. The importance of the research question is posed to analyze not only the commonly recognized demographics of race, but also demographics such as household income level.
