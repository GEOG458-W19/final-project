# final-project
70 Points Total

Bringing together the various tools you have been learning this quarter, your group will work together to produce several different approaches to exploring a research question of your choosing (see below). At its core, the project will involve making and comparing/contrasting (at minimum) two types of maps exploring one phenomenon (at least one of which must be interactive), as well as visualizing whatever non-spatial data helps the viewer understand the phenomenon. These maps and visualizations should be compelling to viewers, and follow good aesthetic design principles. They will be paired with a narrative component that explains your data, the relevance of your research question, and your findings.

The final product can come in a number of forms, but should be presentable to your viewer as if you were going to make the results public. You also need to give your viewer easy access to the code lying behind what you’ve produced—so try to keep it all in one place, ideally one script, .rmd or .ipynb file, which you can link to—but you’ll likely want to hide most of that code in the final product. That could mean an R Markdown HTML document, as we created for our R Labs, an R Markdown-produced slideshow, as I used in the lectures on R, a Shiny app of some sort, or, possibly, a very well formatted Jupyter Notebook (this one might be a bit harder to “hide” unnecessary code). You can discuss alternate presentation methods with me, but I do *not* want you using Powerpoint, etc. This should be something that integrates coding with your final presentation.

Throughout the quarter, your labs have encouraged you to perform exploratory data analysis and engage in narrative cartography. In your final project, viewers should be able to contextualize and comprehend the data through the combination of maps, non-spatial visualizations and your narration. Remember that narrative approaches to data and cartography require the researcher to dig down into the particulars of the data in order to contextualize it through examples. So choose meaningful, representative subsets of your overall data to focus on, and make sure you are following good practices in data management in general: normalizing when needed, making clear to the viewer what variables are being visualized, etc.

**Research Question**: Your previous labs have both focused on developing your methodological skills in digital geography and your ability to narrate explorations of your data to a viewer. But you have largely done this on data and topics that have been chosen for you. In your final project, by contrast, you will choose a theme and a question that are intellectually significant. You will then have to obtain the data you need to explore this theme and (potentially) answer this question.

Compared to many studies, your question can be relatively 'exploratory'. A question whose answer is simple or unambiguous does not necessarily lead to the most interesting results using these methods. However, your question should be amenable to investigation in some way through the forms of digital inquiry we have been learning in 458. You will receive feedback early on about whether what you’ve chosen seems like it will work for this purpose.

On Monday, March 4th, you will need to have at least one good idea for your research question. On this day I will meet with each group to discuss what you’ve chosen, make sure it is feasible, and to ask you about how you plan to approach the question. This meeting is a graded part of your final project, if you as an individual miss this meeting without notifying me (in case of sickness, etc.) you will have 5 points removed from your individual score for the final project.

**Groups**: This work will be done in your groups. In order to further streamline your group dynamics, you might want to refer to this advice (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. about how to improve project management skills.

**Github**: You will be using Github as we have for our labs. I’d strongly suggest you put everything related to the Final Project in one place within your Group Github.

Here are more instructions about the two types of mapping you will use:

## Part 1 - Exploratory Cartographic Analysis
25 points

**Thematic data**: Your data should not come ready-made. It’s okay to start with some GIS-format files, but you should ideally be “building up” a dataset (or a number of them) by processing data not already available in map-able form, making it map-able, and then likely further modifying it—either analytically (for example, performing a cluster analysis), or for purposes of visualization.  

Ideally, you’ll want to choose a dataset to create that you haven't used before in this class. That said, it is okay to scale up from some of the data we’ve already used in our labs to perform a similar, but large and more complex type of analysis. This is particularly true of the LODES data, which you could potentially use for a number of other things. But you could also use the China data, adding a number of additional variables to do a deeper analysis. So don’t feel like you have to completely avoid these sources, just discuss your ideas with me and see if it will work—to take one example, it would be totally fine to try to use the LODES data and perform similar analyses as those you used in Lab 2, but for the entire country. That added difficulty makes it sufficiently scaled up for this to be a valid project. You could also use the LODES data in combination with something else, or use it as part of a much larger “impact analysis” on an area, etc.

**Base and contextual data/layers**: You must determine the contextual factors that are meaningful and relevant to the phenomenon that you are investigating and include them within your mapping and other data visualization. Do not overwhelm the main theme you are investigating. But do think about including distributions of a relevant phenomenon that may provide context (or contrast!) to the phenomenon you are investigating--perhaps by using population density for tweets, adding neighborhood boundaries for visual orientation, adding a water boundaries layer, etc.

**Interactive visualization**: Produce maps that enable a user to explore your question. At least one map must be a well-designed interactive map, with a decent amount of depth (this basically means don’t just throw one layer over a random basemap). It is okay to produce multiple interactive maps, as well as (or in the place of) static ones. Your maps’ styling and intellectual approach should be both intentional/designed and reasonably sophisticated. Make the map operate (maybe differently) at different zoom layers, perhaps bringing out different perspectives on the data/question. If it is appropriate to include a basic degree of tooltip interactivity and/or legends to aid the user in understanding the data, do so. 

Getting data for this interactive mapping part of the assignment is important! But don't let the challenges dominate either: 1) the intellectual dimension to the assignment—framing a good issue and a question, or 2) the narrative cartography part.

## Part 2 -  Documentation, Narration, Argumentation
20 points

The project has a strong narrative component. Think of this almost as a “cartographic data essay.” You need to do all the things you would do in a normal essay: explain the relevance of your question, contextualize the question itself, then make an argument about what your results show and why these results are themselves useful in answering this question. As with all data analysis, don’t worry if your initial hypothesis is disproven! That’s a scientifically useful result!

Another dimension of the “cartographic data essay” format is the fact that you’ll need to document everything. This takes multiple forms: 1) you need to cite sources, particularly in introducing your guiding question and the reasons for its relevance 2) you also need to cite sources in explaining the potential problems with the data, as you have had to do in previous labs, and, 3) you’ll also need to document your own analytic process by citing and linking to your code in the final product itself (this will probably mean adding one or several footnotes linking to the full code scripts hosted publicly on github). Make sure your code itself is annotated and readable, I will be grading this as well!

Note: As always, you don't have to use your real names on this or any other part of your public-facing materials if you don't want to, as long as you have submitted your links as described in the submission instructions below.

## Part 3 – Meetings and Presentations
25 points

As mentioned above, on Monday, March 4th, you will need to have at least one good idea for your research question. Every group member must attend the meeting with me during class time on this day. This is worth 5 points, and any individual who does not attend will have those points removed from their individual score (e-mail me in case of sickness, etc.)

Then, we will be having presentations on the final Wednesday of normal classes, March 13th, during our regular class time. This is worth 20 points.

Please make sure all your work is up on github and submitted to canvas, both as an assignment and posted in the group discussion area (see below) by this time.

You will be graded on how well you communicate your process and findings to the class. This includes basic things such as speaking loudly enough so that people can hear you and articulating your main points in an understandable way, as well as more technical things like the design of your final product. There will be a space in Canvas to post links to your final project materials, so that the rest of the class can follow along if they wish.

**Submission Instructions**:
Each group member should submit a link to your final files in the Github repo. Include a README.md file that gives a brief boilerplate summary of your project and a link to the final presentation.

In addition to this one designated group member must submit this link to the Canvas Final Project Discussion Page, so that your classmates can see and interact with your final product during the presentation.

**EXTRA CREDIT: 4 points of extra credit will be added to the score of any group that hosts their final product on their student web server. See the resources page for some more detail, and read through the University’s information on student web servers here (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. Note that you still need the final document(s) to be in your Github as well, but your link in the Discussion page can go to the web server.**

**Some Useful Tools**:
1) Although I don’t want you making your final maps in ArcMap or ArcGIS Online, you CAN use Mapbox (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. if you’d like. Mapbox is one of the best ways to manually create your own styling for interactive maps, Mapbox has a more direct plug-in functionality with both python and R. For python, see the tools here (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and here (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site., and this example (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. may also be helpful. For R, see Chapter 8.4 of the Lovelace book, specifically the section on using mapdeck (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. Here is a little more info on mapdeck (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. with some examples. Remember that you have to access Mapbox via its API, which requires tokens (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site., which are limited. Since we won’t be learning Mapbox in great detail for any required lab, you’ll need to run yourself through a few tutorials (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. if you want to use it.

2) You may want to interact with social media data for your project. Twitter is probably the easiest to access. For more info in how to mine text from Twitter in R, see this blog post (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site., and for how to do the same with the tidytext package, see this post (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. In python, you can use the tweepy library, see this blog post (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site., or this more detailed series of posts (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. for some instructions. Again, you’ll need to be using the Twitter API and going through some additional steps to access this data.

3) You may also want to create some sort of web app for your final product. Feel free to use skills you’ve picked up elsewhere to do so! But you can also use Shiny in R, here is a long written tutorial (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. on how to do so, and here (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. is an equally long (sorry) video tutorial. For python, the alternatives are either Bokeh (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. or Dash (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site., read through this comparison of the two (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. to decide on which you’d like to use.

4) If you have an idea but don’t know how to pursue it using the tools we have learned, ask me prior to the Monday, March 4th meeting so that I can potentially point you in the direction of some useful libraries and/or other tools!
