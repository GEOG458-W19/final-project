### Final Project: Seattle's 911 Calls
For our [final project](https://wliang25.shinyapps.io/final-project/), we are analyzing the relationship between the type and quantity of 911 calls within neighborhoods in Seattle to its population demographics and distance calculations to the nearest emergency services such as fire stations and hospitals. Our **research question** includes finding out if **_there is a correlation between the average distances of call location and their nearest emergency services_** as well as if **_there is some correlation between the population of certain neighborhoods of Seattle and the quantity of calls received in those locations_**. The topic at hand is very relevant as we can use this data to predict hot spots of different types of incidences. For example, if we are able to locate areas that have observed more 911 calls which require advice life care services and medical attention, the city can address the need and create more ambulance staging areas to improve the efficiency of caring for the residents in those areas. Another example is if an area has observed higher rates of fire calls, the city can see where they can more strategically put the fire departments. The research question is posed to help further understand the importance of strategically placing emergency services based on the average historical call locations.
